Caramel
Size:
1x recipe makes 1 cup

Ingredients:
1 cup granulated sugar (200g) 	*make sure it’s labeled “pure cane”
6 tbsp unsalted butter, sliced, room temp  (85g)
½ cup heavy cream, room temp (120mL/g)
1 tsp salt

Instructions:
Heat the granulated sugar in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly until it becomes a thick brown, amber-colored liquid (~ 6 min)
Avoid using a nonstick saucepan, be careful not to burn the sugar
Immediately stir in the butter until melted and combined.
The caramel will bubble rapidly
If the butter separates, or if the sugar clumps, remove it from the heat and vigorously whisk to recombine (~3-4 min), and return to the heat when recombined
Very slowly pour in the heavy cream while stirring constantly
Mixture will rapidly bubble
Stop stirring and allow the mixture to boil for 1 minute.  It will rise as it does so.
If using a candy thermometer, wait till it hits 220 oF (104oC).
Remove from the heat and stir in the salt
Caramel will be a thin liquid at this point.  Allow to slightly cool down before using.

Notes/Tips:
No alterations were made to the original
Cover tightly and store for up to 1 month, refrigerated.  It will solidify in the fridge, but can be reheated in the microwave or stove to the desired consistency
See recipe instructions for the specific tips

Lemon Curd (Modified)
Size:
Guesstimating that 1x recipe makes about ½ cup filling

Ingredients:
----- Step 1: ------------------
75 mL/g water
⅓ cup sugar (67g)
1 tbsp cornstarch (10g)
1 tbsp lemon zest (~6g)
¼ tsp salt
----- Step 2: ------------------
75 mL/g lemon juice
2 egg yolks
----- Step 3: ------------------
1 tbsp butter
½ tsp vanilla extract

Instructions:
In a medium saucepan, whisk together the step 1 ingredients: water, sugar, cornstarch, lemon zest, and salt.
Bring to a boil, whisking often.
Boil for 1-2 minutes or until smooth, it’s almost transparent, and starts to thicken.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the step 2 ingredients: egg yolks and lemon juice.
Slowly pour the hot sugar mixture into the yolks, whisking constantly.
Return everything to the saucepan.  Whisking constantly, bring the mixture back to a boil, and boil for 2-3 minutes or until significantly thickened.
It will feel runny.  Once it starts boiling, it will significantly thicken very quickly.  Boil this thickened liquid for 2-3 minutes, whisking constantly.
Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter and vanilla.
Ready for use!

Notes/Tips:
Edits made to the original recipe:
¼ tsp vanilla → ½ tsp vanilla
120 mL/g water → 75 mL/g
30 mL/g lemon juice → 75 mL/g
Added 1 tbsp (~6g) lemon zest
You can play with the ratio of water to lemon juice based on the preferred flvor strength.  As long as the liquids add to 150 mL per 1x recipe batch, you’re good!

Apple Cider Cake
Size: Recipe makes an 8x8 inch baking pan
We doubled the recipe and made 3 9” diameter cake tins

Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tsp baking soda
½ tsp salt
⅔ cup granulated sugar
¾ tsp ground cinnamon
⅛ tsp ground nutmeg
1 cup unsweetened applesauce
8 tbsp unsalted butter melted
¼ cup apple cider (NOT vinegar)
1 large egg
1 tsp vanilla extract

Instructions:
Grease the baking vessel with and line the bottom with parchment paper.  Preheat the oven to 325 F.
Combine the flour, baking soda and salt. Mix and set aside.
In a larger, separate bowl, mix the sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg.
Reserve about 2 tbsp of the cinnamon-sugar mixture for sprinkling the top before baking.  (We skipped this and it turned out fine)
Add the applesauce, melted butter, apple cider, egg and vanilla extract to the cinnamon-sugar mixture, and stir to combine.
Slowly whisk in the flour mixture to the applesauce mixture. Do not overmix.
Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and smooth the top with a spatula.
Sprinkle the reserved cinnamon-sugar mix over the top of the batter.
Bake at 325 F for about 30-35 minutes or until it passes the toothpick test.
We start checking at 27 minutes, then for 3 minute intervals when we made 3 9” cakes.  I forgot if we changed the total time baked.
Let the pan rest for 10 minutes on a cooling rack, then take the cake out and to let it finish cooling

Notes/Tips:
We frosted the whole thing with 32 oz whipped, plain stabilized whipped cream, and included apple pie filling between each layer.

Reviews:
The intended result is a bit too rich for my taste.  It turned out very tasty, like a pound cake but personally I prefer my cakes lighter and somewhat less sweet.
The whipped cream cut the richness of the cake, which was nice
Other people loved it though!
